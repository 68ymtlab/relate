- Flow results analytics
  --> time taken per question

- record end flow with a null page visit

- web hooks for auto-fetch and auto-preview

- comment box http://jsfiddle.net/9Le8X/2/
- question bank
  -> localize an elaborate question and all its 'stuff' (JS, media)
  -> use a media search path
- flow overview
- Instant flow request
- time limits, extra time?
- Student tags, adapt homepage

- Flow group ordering, max page count, question/page tags

- Deferred grading (essays etc, per question)
- Grading stages
  (Autograder: works, TA: code not fishy)

- Custom matcher classes

- Name X out of Y question
- Multi text question
- Multi MC question
- Rank/order question
