CourseFlow
==========

"I just want to ask my students some quiz questions online. How hard could it
possibly be?"

CourseFlow is a `Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/>`_-based courseware
package that lets students participate in online activities. Each such activity
is called a "flow". It flows over a couple of pages, each of which can be, say,
a video, a quiz question, a page of text, or, within the confines of HTML,
something completely different.

CourseFlow is set apart by the following features:

* Emphasizes ease of authoring, using `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_,
  `Markdown <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_ and Python.
  See `example content <https://github.com/inducer/courseflow-sample>`_.
* Versioning of content through deep integration with `git <https://git-scm.org>`_.
  Instructors can preview newly-authored content while students work with
  prior versions, all from the same instance of CourseFlow.

Installation
------------

CourseFlow currently works with Python 2.7. (This is because `dulwich
<https://www.samba.org/~jelmer/dulwich/>`_, a dependency, does not yet support
Python 3.)

Install `bower <http://bower.io/>`_ and its dependencies, as described on its
web page.

(Optional) Make a virtualenv to install to::

    virtualenv --system-site-packages my-courseflow-env
    source my-courseflow-env/bin/activate

To install, clone the repository::

    git clone git://github.com/inducer/courseflow

Enter the courseflow directory::

    cd courseflow

Install the dependencies::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Copy (and, optionally, edit) the example configuration::

    cp local_settings.py.example local_settings.py
    vi local_settings.py

Initialize the database::

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser --username=$(whoami)

Retrieve static (JS/CSS) dependencies::

    python manage.py bower install

Run the server::

    python manage.py runserver

Open a browser to http://localhost:8000, sign in (your user name will be the
same as your system user name, or whatever `whoami` returned above) and select
"Set up new course".

Additional setup steps for Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(TODO)

Add to kernel command line, if needed::

    [...] cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1

Change docker config to disallow IP forwarding::

    --ip-forward=false

in :file:`/etc/default/docker.io`.
